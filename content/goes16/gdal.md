### GDAL Setup
The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL; [gdal.org](http://www.gdal.org)) is a library and set of command line tools. GDAL supports reading the GOES-16 NetCDF files after a series of patches were recently upstreamed by the OCC team. The patches should be incorporated into GDAL version 2.2, and so for now GDAL must be built from source to work fully with the GOES-16 dataset.

### Using GDAL with Docker
The easiest way to get started with GDAL is to use the docker image built by OCC which includes the HDF5 & NetCDF libraries. This image builds GDAL from source so it is always the latest version. The dockerfile can be found on the [OCC GDAL container repo](https://github.com/occ-data/containers/tree/master/gdal).

In the directory with the GOES-16 data you want to work with:
```
docker run -d --rm -ti --name gdal -v $(pwd):/data quay.io/occ_data/gdal:latest
```
This command will pull the docker container from Quay, run the container naming it "gdal" for future commands, and mount the current working directory as /data inside the container.

To test that it is working we can run the `gdalinfo` command over a file. This command will tell us information about the file metadata.
```
docker exec -ti gdal gdalinfo OR_ABI-L1b-RadF-M3C02_G16_s20171921545382_e20171921556149_c20171921556183.nc
```
which returns:

The NetCDF files contain subdatasets, in this example `NETCDF:"OR_ABI-L1b-RadF-M3C02_G16_s20171921545382_e20171921556149_c20171921556183.nc":Rad` and `NETCDF:"OR_ABI-L1b-RadF-M3C02_G16_s20171921545382_e20171921556149_c20171921556183.nc":DQF`. These strings can be used as input into GDAL to refer to the specific subsets.


### Unscaling and Converting to PNG
To create a png image which we can view we should first extract the subdataset we are interested in and unscale the data values. The `gdal_translate` program is what we will use for this step. It can extract the dataset and do the unscaling in a single step. The NetCDF files for GOES-16 store most data values as 16-bit integers, however working with 32-bit floating point numbers is significantly easier so we will do that conversion at this step as well.
```
docker exec -ti gdal gdal_translate -ot float32 -unscale -CO COMPRESS=deflate NETCDF:"OR_ABI-L1b-RadF-M3C02_G16_s20171921545382_e20171921556149_c20171921556183.nc":Rad fulldisk.tif
```
If this command runs successfully it should have created a `fulldisk.tif` in your directory.

After you have this fulldisk file you can convert it to a png image again using `gdal_translate`.
```
docker exec -ti gdal gdal_translate -ot Byte -of png -scale 0 650 0 255 fulldisk.tif fulldisk.png
```
This command will convert the tiff file to a png while scaling the data values from 0-650 in the tiff to 0-255 so that they fit in a byte for the png file.

### Reprojecting GOES-16 Data
Now that you have a basic idea of how to work with the data you may be interested in using it in GIS applications such as ArcGIS or QGIS. To do this we need to reproject the data from the geostationary viewpoint into a rectilinear projection such as geographic (just lat-lon values). We will use the `gdalwarp` utility to do this reprojection process while using the tiff file from the previous step.
```
docker exec -ti gdal gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 -dstnodata -999.0 fulldisk.tif fulldisk_geo.tif
```
This step will create a fulldisk_geo.tif file which uses the projection defined by `EPSG:4326` (geographic). This file can be readily loaded into GIS software and reprojected further or displayed with other datasets.

To compare the difference after reprojection we will also create a png file here using a step similar to that in the previous section.
```
docker exec -ti gdal gdal_translate -ot Byte -of png -scale 0 650 0 255 fulldisk_geo.tif fulldisk_geo.png
```
which will create a fulldisk_geo.png file in your current directory. Opening this file you can see the difference where the data has been turned from looking spherical into being elongated and stretched.
